# PowerBI-Dashboards
This is the work I did while undergoing my course training with Pregrad. 

I created dashboards on 2 financial datasets, showing basic information like average revenue and sales over time, and time-series analysis.

I learnt how to use Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, in conjunction.

I studied Python functions like, describe[Showcasing analysed value of whole dataset], .dropna()[to remove null values] etc. , and Data Visualisation tools like Matplotlib, Pandas.
